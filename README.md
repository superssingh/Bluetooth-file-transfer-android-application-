Any file share via Bluetooth android app in android studio

First add below permissions in AndroidManifest.xml 

[1] "android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"              
[2] "android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"                            
[3] "android.permission.BLUETOOTH"                                      
[4] "android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"

After that you need only 3 file for that project.    
one MainActivity.java and two xml files (activity_main.xml and dailoglayout.xml). 
That's it. 

Enjoy.... :)
Happy coding and do cool things.
